# StudyConcierge Video Script (3 minutes)

## Intro (10 seconds)
"Hi, I'm Pruthvi, and this is StudyConcierge — a personal study automation agent built for the Google AI 5-Day Agents Intensive Capstone."

## Problem (20 seconds)
"Students spend too much time planning, summarizing, and organizing study work. It's mentally exhausting and inefficient."

## Why Agents? (20 seconds)
"Agents can reason, call tools, remember context, and automate multi-step workflows. Perfect for study automation."

## Architecture (40 seconds)

### Visual: Show architecture diagram
"StudyConcierge uses a multi-agent system with four specialized agents:

1. Planner agent - powered by Gemini
2. Summarizer agent - with long-running PDF tasks
3. Quiz agent - running in parallel
4. Session manager - tracking progress

All agents work with a Memory Bank and session memory, and use tools for search and PDF processing."

## Demo (40 seconds)

### Visual: Show notebook execution
"In action, StudyConcierge works like this:

First, a user uploads their syllabus and deadlines. The Planner Agent creates a personalized study schedule.

Next, when they provide study materials, the Summarizer Agent processes PDFs or web content into concise summaries.

Then, the Quiz Agent generates practice questions to reinforce learning.

The system remembers past interactions, so it can suggest, 'Create a plan like last week' for consistency.

All actions are tracked through sessions, and every step is logged for observability."

## Build Overview (15 seconds)
"I built StudyConcierge using ADK-Python, Google Search tool, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Memory Bank, long operations, and this Kaggle Notebook."

## Closing (10 seconds)
"This is StudyConcierge — my submission for the Concierge Track. Thank you!"
